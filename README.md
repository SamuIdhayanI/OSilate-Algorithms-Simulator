# OSilate : Algorithm Simulator for OS Concepts

OSilate is an algorithm simulator mobile application developed using Java that helps students visualize OS-related algorithms with their own input and real-world implementations.

### Problem Statement

Understanding and visualizing operating system (OS) algorithms can be challenging for students. Traditional learning methods often lack interactivity and practical implementation, making it difficult for students to grasp the concepts and see how these algorithms work in real-world scenarios.

### Solution Provided by This Project

OSilate addresses this issue by providing an interactive and practical approach to learning OS algorithms. The application allows students to input their own data and visualize the algorithms' execution in real-time. By simulating these algorithms, OSilate helps students understand their behavior, efficiency, and application in real-world systems.

### Target Audience
