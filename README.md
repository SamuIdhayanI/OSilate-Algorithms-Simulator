# OSilate : Algorithm Simulator for OS Concepts

OSilate is an algorithm simulator mobile application developed using Java that helps students visualize OS-related algorithms with their own input and real-world implementations.

### Problem Statement

Understanding and visualizing operating system (OS) algorithms can be challenging for students. Traditional learning methods often lack interactivity and practical implementation, making it difficult for students to grasp the concepts and see how these algorithms work in real-world scenarios.

### Solution Provided by This Project

OSilate addresses this issue by providing an interactive and practical approach to learning OS algorithms. The application allows students to input their own data and visualize the algorithms' execution in real-time. By simulating these algorithms, OSilate helps students understand their behavior, efficiency, and application in real-world systems.

### Target Audience

- **Students**: Individuals studying computer science or related fields who need to understand and visualize OS algorithms.
- **Educators**: Instructors and professors looking for an interactive tool to teach OS algorithms to their students.
- **Self-Learners**: Individuals interested in learning about OS algorithms through practical and interactive methods.
### Features
- Algorithm Visualization: Visualize the execution of various OS algorithms with custom input data.
- Interactive Learning: Input your own data to see how algorithms perform in different scenarios.
- Real-World Implementations: Understand the practical application of OS algorithms through real-world examples.
- Comprehensive Algorithm List: Includes a wide range of OS algorithms:
